            Two songs on Richmond-based singer/songwriter Lucy Dacus' debut album No Burden contain the same chorus:
            "Without you I am surely the last of our kind/ Without you I am surely the last of my kind." The songs,
            "Dream State..." and "...Familiar Place," seem to complete each other elliptically, and approach their
            shared lyric through two different paths; the first describes a flood, both emotional and physical,
            while the second finds its narrator crawling through a dead garden. Both choruses seem to obey the
            physics of dreams: people are lost irretrievably, landscapes shift from domestic to alpine. Dacus
            conveys the warm, human perspective at the center of this turning vortex, a person trying to survive the
            infinite flow of change. No Burden is an uncommonly warm indie rock record. Lead guitar lines pour in
            like slow columns of sunlight, and Dacus' voice itself is a comforting blur. </div>

            <br>
            Lucy Dacus has a warm, sonorous voice, the kind of voice that rings out like a bugle over dialed-up
            amps, the kind of voice that can lull you into feeling safe even when she’s singing about heartbreak,
            abjection, and death. Her second album, Historian, builds on the foundation set by her first, the
            lyrically clever and musically robust No Burden, which caught ears at Matador shortly after its release
            in 2016. As Historian adds new elements to Dacus’ music—strings, horns, vocal effects, and spoken word
            samples appear here alongside guitars, drums, and bass—it also finds the Virginia songwriter plumbing
            new thematic depths and broadening her stage. The album begins with a breakup and climaxes with the
            death of a loved one, two separate events that Dacus integrates into the same story. She doesn’t merely
            reckon with loss or paint a portrait of grief; Historian digs deeper than that. It’s an album about the
            way people carry each other through time.

        <div class=" box box3">2019<br> <img
                src="C:\Users\midni\OneDrive\Documents\CS-html\Intro-to-SCSS-PD8\img\2019.jpg"><br>Fittingly, in the
            holiday singles of her 2019 EP, Lucy Dacus isn’t throwing a party. She adopts a tone similar to Sufjan
            Stevens’ yuletide songs, sifting through the kitschy refuse of culture for little sentiments only she
            knows how to share. Mother’s Day becomes a moment to reflect on and heal from generations of matrilineal
            trauma. The opening lyric of “My Mother & I”—“My mother hates her body/We share the same outline/She
            swears she loves mine”—never sounded more gorgeous than when she performed the song alongside her own
            mother, during a Mother’s Day show in Asheville. On “Fool’s Gold,” New Year’s Eve fades into New Year’s
            Day, and Dacus sits alone and anxious in the ruins of the party she threw. And the Fourth, her favorite
            holiday, loses its luster as she asks listeners to consider their own complicity in American atrocities.
            She treats her weighty subjects with careful concision: short lines, simple phrasing. These are among
            the best songs she’s ever written.</div>
