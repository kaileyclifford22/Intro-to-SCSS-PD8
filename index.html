    <h1>Lucy Dacus Review by Album</h1>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="box box1">No Burden<br>No Burden is Lucy Dacus’s debut album. An indie rock album, No
                Burden
                surprises listeners with how warm and comforting it truly is. The opening track,<i> I Don’t Wanna Be
                    Funny Anymore</i>, focuses on feeling misplaced in social situations and wanting to change who you
                are, but being unable to. Both upbeat and melancholy, this song is one of Dacus’s most popular songs and
                it is easily understandable why. The next song,<i>Troublemaker Doppelganger</i>, is an ode to a
                lookalike of a girl
                Dacus once knew, who used her beauty to influence and manipulate others, and touches on both feeling
                safe from
                the world and keeping the world safe from herself. The following two songs, <i>Green Eyes,Red Face</i>
                and <i>Strange Torpedo</i>, appear to be connected as both are love songs, though with very different
                messages, it seems.<i>Green Eyes, Red Face</i> is a slow and kind love song, while <i>Strange
                    Torpedo</i> is about loving someone who doesn't love or take care of themselves. The following
                track,<i> Dream State... </i>, is a slow and sad
                song about questioning your feelings for someone you are close with, and wondering how they feel about
                you. The next two songs, <i>Trust</i> and<i> Map On A Wall</i>, are about trusting yourself and learning
                to take care of yourself before others. Her next song, <i>Direct Address</i>, is, as the title implies,
                a song written directly to the person she is interested in. Her feelings are unrequited, so she is
                attempting to move past this person, but still stumbles and has trouble. The closing track on this
                album,
                <i> … Familiar Place</i>, appears to be a continuation of the song <i>Dream State…</i>, due to the
                ellipses and the chorus the two songs
                share. The song implies that she is on the road to recovering from her feelings for the person mentioned
                in <i>Dream State…</i> .All in all, most of this album appears to be one cohesive chronological story
                about
                developing unrequited feelings for someone who you can not be with, either because they do not take care
                of themselves or because you have been friends for too long, and recovering from that heartbreak and
                finding yourself. Even the songs that are not directly correlated with this plot, such as <i>I Don’t
                    Wanna
                    Be Funny Anymore</i> and <i>Troublemaker Doppelganger</i> are about struggling with both finding and
                trusting
                yourself. This album tells a story of growth through both slow and sad songs that are always beautifully
                written and incredibly memorable.</div>
            <div class="box box2">Historian <br> Historian is Lucy Dacus’s second and most popular album. This album is
                both beautiful and heartbreaking, and intertwines stories of breakups and losing loved ones.The opening
                track, and Dacus’s most popular song, Night Shift, is about recovering from a breakup and restructuring
                her life to avoid your ex, even though she still has feelings for them, despite their implied bad
                treatment. The following song, Addictions, is presumably about the same person, and being dependent on a
                person you need to move past. The next song, The Shell, is somewhat more hopeful, and is about staying
                confident through feelings of creative burnout, despite feeling empty and purposeless when you’re not
                creating. The succeeding song, NonBeliever, can be interpreted many ways. The song is both about Dacus’s
                own experience coming out of Christianity after growing up in a small, insular community, as well as her
                father leaving his small hometown to move to Chicago. The way Dacus describes it is,”nonbelief in a
                religion, nonbelief in a city, non belief in a friendship. The next track, Yours and Mine, is a
                centerpiece of the album, was inspired by the Baltimore protests against racism and police brutality,
                and is about feeling ashamed to come home (from Europe, where she was residing at the time) to a country
                she had no pride in. The next song, Body to Flame, is an homage to friendship. The song took its name
                from a friend of Lucy’s, who told her that they planned to light themselves on fire someday, making
                Dacus feel both incredibly close and far from them. She then launches into the song Timefighter, a song
                about recognizing your own mortality. This song connects to Next of Kin, the following song, which is
                about deciding to live after realizing your own death is imminent. Dacus thought this song encapsulated
                the ‘overarching statement of the record”. The last two songs on this album, Pillar of Truth and
                Historians, are about loss. Pillar of Truth is about Dacus’s grandmother, and is a surprisingly positive
                song. Dacus says that her grandmother knew she was going to die, and took care of everything in a very
                head-on way, a way that inspired Dacus.Historians, the last song on the album, is about two people who
                are intertwined with each other, and are capturing each other's lives and what would happen when one of
                them passes away. Historian is a beautiful collection of stories, sung and illustrated through Lucy
                Dacus's rich voice, and the strength of her backing band.
